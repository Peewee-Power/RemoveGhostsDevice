# Remove Ghost Devices (PowerShell Script)
 [![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/Q5Q31II1W0)

Hi! 👋  
I'm a hobby scripter and I like to help people do useful things on Windows —  
even if they don’t know much about how Windows works behind the scenes.

This little PowerShell script removes “ghost devices” (old or hidden devices no longer connected to your system).

> ⚠️ **Administrator rights are required.**  
> No need to open PowerShell manually — just right-click the script and select  
> **"Run with PowerShell"**. Windows will prompt for administrator access.

## What it does

- Finds all ghost (non-present) devices on your system
- Shows you a list of them
- You can choose:
  - Delete all at once
  - Or delete them one by one

## How to use it

1. Right-click the script file.
2. Choose **"Run with PowerShell"**.
3. Windows will ask for Admin rights — click **Yes**.
4. The script will start, show the ghost devices, and let you pick what to do.

> 🛠️ You don’t need to know any PowerShell. Just run the script and follow the prompts.

## Requirements

- Windows (tested on Windows 10 and 11)
- Admin rights (the script will ask for them automatically)

## Why this script?

Sometimes Windows keeps old device entries even if the hardware is gone.  
This can slow things down or just clutter your system. This script helps clean that up easily.

## Disclaimer

I’m not a pro — just someone who likes to tinker and help.  
Please use the script at your own risk. If you’re unsure, ask someone you trust or check the code before running.
